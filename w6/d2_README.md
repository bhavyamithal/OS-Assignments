This is a program that simulates the banker's algorithm for resource allocation to processes. The banker's algorithm is a deadlock-avoidance algorithm that ensures that a system will not enter a deadlock state by checking whether it is safe to allocate resources to a process.

The program takes as input the number of processes and the number of resources. It then asks for the number of available instances of each resource type and the maximum demand of each process for each resource type. With this information, it calculates the need of each process for each resource type and initializes the allocation matrix to 0.

The program then prompts the user to either request or release resources. If the user chooses to request resources, the program checks whether the request can be granted without putting the system in an unsafe state. If the request can be granted, the program allocates the resources and checks whether the resulting state is safe. If the resulting state is safe, the program informs the user that the request has been granted. If the resulting state is unsafe, the program deallocates the resources and informs the user that the request cannot be granted. If the user chooses to release resources, the program deallocates the resources and informs the user that the resources have been released.

The program also provides a function to calculate a safe sequence of processes to allocate resources to, given the current state of the system. If no safe sequence exists, the function returns NULL. The program uses this function to check whether a request can be granted without putting the system in an unsafe state.
